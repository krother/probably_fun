.. topic:: Acknowledgements

   This book would not have been possible without the guidance of `Christina Valentiner-Brandt of the Brettspielakademie <https://brettspielakademie.de/>`__.
   It has benefited from discussions with my brilliant data teacher colleagues Paula Gonzales-Avalos and Hilal Işık.
   I would also like to thank Isabelle Kranabetter and Tilo Storz for the professional exchange.
   I thank my fellow participants at the Brettspielakademie courses in Hamburg and Herne.
   Special thanks go to John Zimmer, Florian Mueck, Adam Weisbart and the developers of the Stryer Biochemistry Game
   who were the first to show me that you can make teaching games that are actually fun to play.
   Finally, I'd like to thank all my students at the SRH University Berlin who playtested my lessons.
   
   **It was fun playing with you!**
