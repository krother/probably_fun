Teaching notes
--------------

The Data Portrait is an easy start into a class or course on a data-related subject.
There are several concepts that can be motivated with the portraits:

- what data is
- types of data
- data collection
- data visualization
- conventions and bias
- put the data from drawing into a spreadsheet or file and start evaluating it

In a presence class, your participants may want to hang up and present their artwork.
The exercise works in an online or hybrid environment as well.
