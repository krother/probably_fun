=======================

Goal
----

Students generate data about themselves.

Instructions
------------

Take a piece of paper

-  draw as many **squares** as your name has characters
-  draw **circles** for the number of people in your household
-  draw a **symbol** that indicates your country of birth
-  draw your favourite **mode of transportation**: legs for walking, two
   circles for biking, a box with wheels for cars/trains and wings for flying
-  **charge%** of your mobile device as a battery with 0-5 bars

Teaching notes
--------------

The Data Portrait is an easy start into a class or course on a data-related subject.
There are several concepts that can be motivated with the portraits:

- what data is
- types of data
- data collection
- data visualization
- conventions and bias
- put the data from drawing into a spreadsheet or file and start evaluating it

In a presence class, your participants may want to hang up and present their artwork.
The exercise works in an online or hybrid environment as well.
