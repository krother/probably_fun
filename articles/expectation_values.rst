Build Cities with Expectation Values
====================================

Goal
----
Students calculate expectation values in a dice game.

Time
----

90'

Lesson Plan
-----------

- play a round of **Machi Koro** or a similar game
- the game works in 4 teams of 2, so 8 people can play at one table. So 2-3 boxes are enough to keep most classes busy.
- stop the game when all tables have finished or after a 20'-30' time box.
- now you want to analyze the total worth of one players' city.
- introduce the concept and equation for the **expectation value**.
- calculate one city for a roll of one die together on the board
- do the same for a roll of two dice.
- you can introduce **assumptions** for handling the cafes: in the early phase of the game it is easy to spend most of your money. So you might assume that you do not pay anything.
- in the phase where you are saving up for a big building the cafes become quite important. You might assume that you always pay the full amount to the other cafe owners.
- with cafes you may find **negative expectation values**

.. hint::

   For a shorter game time in **Machi Koro**, remove the fourth player building.
   Also remove the purple buildings.
   
Extra tasks:
------------

The alternative rolls with one or two dice are a great opportunity to introduce **histograms** and **distributions of discrete variables**.

Things you can do:

- ask students to draw a histogram of one dice roll (the probability mass function is a discrete uniform distribution)
- ask for the probabilities of two dice rolls. Write them on the board as well.
- ask studens to draw a histogram of two dice rolls (a triangular distribution)
- students might also figure out the number of combinations for three dice as well. It is a bit tedious to go through all the permutations, but it is totally worth it. When they plot the histogram they might start regonizing something similar to the bell curve. In the end, you get an opportunity to introduce the **central limit theorem**, which can be explored further in an extra session on **distributions**.
