The Game
--------

The game **Age of AI** is about creating a timeline of events.
The idea is borrowed from the `Anno Domini <https://abacusspiele.de/produkt-kategorie/anno-domini-serie/>`__
I created a small classroom set with 21 cards with important events from the field of computation and Machine Learning.

Each card has a front side with a short description and a back side with a year and explanation.
Below you find a document that you can print in A4 size (double-sided) so that the game works with a larger group.

The game is played in teams.
The objective of the game is to place cards in the correct order given by the year on the back side.
Correct placement gets you one point per correctly placed card.
The players do not need to guess the exact year, only where a card belongs in the existing timeline.

The correct dates are revealed immediately once a card is placed to not make things too complicated in a bigger group.
This is somewhat different in the original **Anno Domini** game. 
But since you need to find a way to put the cards on display (e.g. stick them to a board or wall),
you need to handle the material carefully so that no years get revealed accidentally.

Lesson Plan
-----------

1. explain the rules
2. create 2-3 teams
3. place the first card on the timeline (stick it to the board)
4. the teams take turns
5. draw a card and read it aloud
6. the team discusses where to place it on the timeline.
7. when they reach consensus, reveal the year and read the other side
8. if the prediction was correct, the team gets a point
9. in any case, place the card on the timeline
