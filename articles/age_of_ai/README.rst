Age of AI
=========

Goal
----

Students create a timeline for the history of artificial intelligence.

Time
----

15'

Concepts
--------

I believe the history of computing is important cultural knowledge.
You can use the game as an energizer.

Of course, you could discuss the concept of **rank** or have students research the topics on the cards, but this is not what I do.

The Game
--------

In the game `Anno Domini <https://abacusspiele.de/produkt-kategorie/anno-domini-serie/>`__, the players create a timeline of events.
I borrowed the idea and created a classroom set with 21 cards with important events in computing, Machine Learning and some trivia.
Each card has a front side with a short description and a back side with a year and explanation.
Below you find printable and editable documents.

.. topic:: Download Materials

    - :download:`Age_of_AI.pdf` - cards to print (two-sided)
    - :download:`Age_of_AI.odt` - editable document

    Print the cards double-sided in A4 size for a set that you can use on a board.
    For smaller cards, print 8 cards on one sheet. You may need to specify the order of pages.
    The order that worked for me is:

    ::

       sheet 1: 1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,10,12,14,16,2,4,6,8
       sheet 2: 17,19,21,23,25,27,29,31,26,28,30,32,18,20,22,24
       sheet 3: 33,35,37,39,41,1,1,1,42,1,1,1,34,36,38,40
                (including dummies)

How to Play
-----------

The objective of the game is to place the cards in the correct chronological order
using the description on the front side.
The relavtive position is what matters, you do not need to guess the exact year.
Then you flip the card and check your guess.
A correctly placed card gets you one point.

1. shuffle the cards
2. place the cards with the years face-down
3. place the first card on the table and read it
4. then turn it over so that you have a starting year
5. the first player (or team) reads the top card.
6. the player decides where it fits on the timeline (a team should reach consensus)
7. reveal the side with the year
8. if the position is correct, the player gets a point
9. if the position is wrong, move the card to the correct place
10. the next player continues with the next card

Lesson Plan
-----------

1. explain the rules
2. create 2+ teams
3. set a clear time limit
4. moderate the game or have the participants play by themselves
5. stop when the time runs out

Hints
-----

The **Age of AI** game works with an entire class divided into 2 teams.
Moderate the game and attach the cards on a board.

If you print several decks of smaller cards, you should be able to organize multiple tables of 3-4 players.

It is not necessary to play through the entire deck. 10-12 cards should be enough. 
Save the rest for another session.
