Guess the Animals with Decision Trees
=====================================

Goal
----

Students construct decision trees to identify animals.

The Twenty Questions Game
-------------------------

One player thinks of an animal. The others try to guess it by asking questions.
The first player only answers "yes" or "no".

Decision Trees are machine learning models that identify questions to make efficient predictions. They are the computerized version of the twenty questions game.

Prerequisites
-------------

Students should have a basic understanding of what machine learning and supervised learning are.

Lesson Plan
-----------

1. Play a few rounds "Twenty Questions" with the class. You think of the first animal, students of the next.
2. Discuss components of a tree (see Figure)
3. ask students to draw a tree for a set of training data

You need for each group a bag with the same number of animals. 
4-6 animals is a good number. Some of the animals should be the same in multiple bags, some could be unique.

Also prepare a bag with
