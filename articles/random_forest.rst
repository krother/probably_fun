Animal Decision Tree
====================

Goal
----

Students construct decision trees to identify animals.

The Twenty Questions Game
-------------------------

One player thinks of an animal. The others try to guess it by asking questions.
The first player only answers "yes" or "no":

::

    Q: can it fly?
    A: no

    Q: does it have 4 legs?
    A: no

    Q: is it a snake?
    A: yes

    Q: is it a Python?
    A: yes!

Decision Trees are machine learning models that identify questions to make efficient predictions. They are the computerized version of the twenty questions game.

Prerequisites
-------------

Students should have a basic understanding of what machine learning and supervised learning are.

Lesson Plan
-----------

1. Play a few rounds "Twenty Questions" with the class. You think of the first animal, students of the next.
2. Discuss components of a tree (see Figure)
3. ask students to draw a tree for a set of training data
4. put the trees on display in class
5. make predictions for all animals in the test set for all trees
6. calculate the accuracy of each individual tree
7. make a consensus prediction (majority vote)
8. calculate the accuracy of the consensus


You need for each group a bag with 4 different animals.
The animals should be from a pool of 6-8 distinct animals.

Also prepare a bag with 4-8 animals from the same pool for testing.


.. note::

    The choice of animals is crucial for how good the random forest works.
