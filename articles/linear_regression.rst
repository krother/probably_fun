Linear Regression
=================

Lesson Goal:
------------

Students calculate a line of best fit.

Key Concepts:
-------------

-  line of best fit
-  linear equation
-  slope
-  intercept
-  mean squared error

Content Delivery:
-----------------

-  create a scatterplot from a sample of quartet cards
-  look for linear relationships
-  draw a line of best fit by hand
-  ask for the linear equation y=mx+b
-  find parameters
-  draw error bars and calculate the MSE
-  draw an example of confounding and discuss why the linear fit can be
   misleading

Comments:
---------

Obviously, linear regression can be taken a lot further. For an
introduction to the statistical concept, using a black-box linreg
function like in Excel or seaborn works. Especially in a course on
Machine Learning you might want to follow up with any of the following:

-  `correlation <correlation.rst>`__
-  multiple linear regression
-  how to find optimal parameters (Normal Equation vs.Â Gradient Descent)
-  regularization, Ridge, Lasso
-  assumptions and the Gauss-Markov Theorem
