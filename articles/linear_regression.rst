Linear Regression
=================

TODO image: quartet scatterplot

Lesson Goal:
------------

Students calculate a line of best fit.

Time
----

45'

Key Concepts:
-------------

- linear equation
- slope
- intercept
- linear regression
- line of best fit
- log-scale
- mean squared error


Lesson Plan
-----------

1. share 12 top trump quartet cards to teams of students (countries, like in :ref:`centrality_and_spread`)
2. have students create a scatterplot from their sample (on paper)
3. discuss the results together
4. look for linear relationships (e.g. area vs. population)
5. plot the same data again on a double-log scale
6. draw a line of best fit by hand
7. ask for the equation of the line (y=ax+b)
8. estimate the slope and intercept from the drawing
9. draw error bars and calculate the MSE


Results

Comments:
---------

Obviously, linear regression can be taken a lot further.
Here, the focus is on the visualization and the basic equation.
For an introduction to the statistical concept, using a black-box linreg
function like in Excel or seaborn works. Especially in a course on
Machine Learning you might want to follow up with any of the following:

-  :ref:`correlation`
-  multiple linear regression
-  how to find optimal parameters (Normal Equation vs.Â Gradient Descent)
-  regularization, Ridge, Lasso
-  assumptions and the Gauss-Markov Theorem
