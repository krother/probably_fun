*game scene in Splendor*

Goal
----

Students implement a data model.

Time
----

120'

Lesson Plan
-----------

1. play a game of Splendor (or similar) for 20'-30'
2. ask: **"now we want to save the state of the game. What do we need?"**
3. task students to draw a data model/class diagram
4. hand out paper
5. let them draw for a while
6. compare results
7. create a model together on the board
8. implement it in SQL or a programming language

.. hint::

    By now, I have run a similar approach with multiple games: **Boggle**, **Yatzhee** and **Connect Four**.
    Many more are possible. Because data modeling is one of the most fundamental skills in data processing,
    it may be worth to model multiple games in the same course.
