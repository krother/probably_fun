Descriptive Statistics
======================

Lesson Goal:
------------

Students calculate measures of centrality and spread from data

Time Frame:
-----------

180â€™

Key Concepts:
-------------

Types of Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  category
-  ordinal
-  scalar
-  datetime
-  discrete
-  continuous

Measures of Centrality
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  mean
-  median
-  mode

Measures of Spread
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  range
-  standard deviation
-  quartiles

Warmup:
-------

`Data Portrait
exercise <http://www.academis.eu/statistics/exercises/centrality_and_dispersion.html>`__

Content Delivery:
-----------------

-  collect data from the data portrait in a spreadsheet (alternative:
   use quartet cards because it is GDPR-safe)
-  identify variable types, enumerate them
-  calculate measures of centrality and introduce equations
-  discuss tricky cases add an outlier
-  calculate measures of spread and introduce equations
-  plot the data (bar plot and/or box plot)
-  exercise 13: Plausibility

Material:
---------

The following exercise set can be done in Python or an online
spreadsheet:

Comments:
---------

This is a good topic to start a course on **descriptive statistics**
with. The time frame includes time for front matter and getting to know
the group.

With computer scientists, I spend some time disambiguating the term
**variable type** from **data type**.
