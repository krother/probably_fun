Guess a Correlation
===================

Lesson Goal:
------------

Students calculate correlation coefficients.

Time Frame:
-----------

90â€™

Key Concepts:
-------------

-  correlation coefficient
-  scatter plot
-  causation

Warmup:
-------

Show some plots from the website `Spurious
Correlations <https://tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations>`__. Ask
students what they think.

Content Delivery:
-----------------

-  create a scatterplot from a sample of quartet cards
-  look for linear relationships (establish **correlation**)
-  introduce the equation for the correlation coefficient
-  go through possible values of R and their interpretation
-  exercise: play
   `www.guessthecorrelation.com/ <https://www.guessthecorrelation.com/>`__
-  calculate the correlation coefficient for one example
-  create a heat map of correlations of all against all columns

Material:
---------

-  quartet cards
-  alternative: penguin data or any other dataset with multiple
   variables

Comments:
---------

Correlation as a concept is much easier to establish if students worked
with linear regression before. Likewise, the equation for R using
covariance can be comfortably replaced by:

:math:`r = \frac{m \cdot std_x}{std_y}`

which is a lot more digestible than the equation using covariance.

You might want to introduce :math:`r^2` as a metric for the quality of
the linear fit, take note to emphasize how the square changes things.
